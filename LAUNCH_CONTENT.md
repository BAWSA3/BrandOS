# DAY 1 (TODAY) - INNER CIRCLE SEEDING

## DM Template for Close Network (Send to 20-30 people)
```
You're one of the first people with access to BrandOS.

Your invite: mybrandos.app?invite=[CODE]

Find out your Brand DNA before anyone else.

Would love your honest feedback.
```

## Morning Post (Mystery Tease)
```
Something's coming.

Inner Circle only for now.
```

## Afternoon Post (Your Brand DNA Reveal)
```
Just found out I'm The Prophet.

Brand DNA Score: 87/100

BrandOS analyzed my entire X presence — my tweets, my positioning, my voice.

And it revealed exactly what kind of brand I've been building.

What does yours say?
```

## Evening Post (Building in Public)
```
The feedback from Inner Circle has been wild.

Shipping fixes live.

This is why you build with early users first.
```

---

# DAY 2 - THREAD DAY

## Morning Thread (Your Main Reveal)
```
I built an AI that reads your X profile and reveals your Brand DNA.

Here's what it found about me:

🧵👇
```

```
First, it analyzed 6 months of my tweets.

Not just what I said — but how I said it.

The patterns. The positioning. The voice.
```

```
Then it scored me on 4 dimensions:

→ Voice consistency
→ Authority signals
→ Engagement quality
→ Strategic positioning

My score: 87/100
```

```
But the most interesting part?

It assigned me an archetype.

There are 8 total:
• Underdog Arc
• The Degen
• The Anon
• Chief Vibes Officer
• The Plug
• Ship or Die
• The Professor
• The Prophet

I'm The Prophet.
```

```
Each archetype has an evolution path.

You start somewhere. You level up.

Underdog Arc → The Degen → Ship or Die → The Professor → The Prophet

Your archetype isn't random. It's earned.
```

```
Why does this matter?

Because 95% of AI-generated content sounds the same.

Generic. Forgettable. Off-brand.

BrandOS fixes that by learning YOUR voice first.

Before it creates anything.
```

```
Right now, it's Inner Circle only.

Public launch is Monday.

But if you want early access — DM me.

I have a few invite codes left.
```

## Afternoon (Engagement)
*RT and quote-tweet every Inner Circle member who shares their score*

## Evening Post (DM Offer)
```
DM me if you want an early invite code.

I have 10 left.
```

# DAY 3 - SOCIAL PROOF BUILDING

## Morning Post
```
Inner Circle update:

→ 47 people scanned their Brand DNA
→ 23 shared their score cards
→ Most common archetype: Chief Vibes Officer
→ Highest score so far: 94

The data is getting interesting.

Public launch Monday.
```

## Afternoon (Template for Members to Share)
*Send this to each Inner Circle member:*
```
Hey! Would you mind sharing your BrandOS score? Here's a template you can customize:

"Just got early access to @BrandOS.

My Brand DNA score: [X]/100
Archetype: [Y]

This is eerily accurate.

[link to your score card]"
```

## Evening Post
```
The archetypes are hitting different.

Some reactions from Inner Circle:

"How did it know I was rebuilding my positioning?"

"The Degen archetype called me out hard"

"94/100 but somehow I feel attacked"

Monday.
```

# DAY 4 (THURSDAY) - HYPE BUILDING

## Morning Thread (Problem Awareness)
```
95% of AI-generated content sounds the same.

Here's why your brand is getting lost:

🧵
```

```
AI writes like AI.

It doesn't know your voice.
It doesn't know your positioning.
It doesn't know what makes YOU different.

So it defaults to generic.
```

```
The result?

→ Content that could've been written by anyone
→ Posts that don't sound like you
→ A feed that's forgettable

Your brand is getting diluted.
```

```
Most tools try to fix this with "tone settings."

Professional. Casual. Friendly.

That's not voice. That's vibes.

Voice is specific. Voice is earned. Voice is YOU.
```

```
What if AI understood your brand FIRST?

What if it analyzed your actual content — your patterns, your positioning, your audience — before creating anything?

We built something to fix this.

Public access Monday.
```

## Afternoon Post (Engagement Poll)
```
What's your biggest struggle with keeping your content on-brand?

↓ Finding your voice
↓ Staying consistent
↓ Sounding authentic with AI
↓ All of the above
```

## Evening Post (Agent Tease)
```
Meet your new marketing team:

→ Campaign Agent (plans your launches)
→ Content Agent (writes in YOUR voice)
→ Analytics Agent (finds what's working)
→ Research Agent (spots trends early)
→ Authority Agent (builds your positioning)

5 AI agents. One Brand DNA.

Monday.
```

# DAY 5 (FRIDAY) - ARCHETYPE REVEAL

mybrandos.app
```

## 9:15 AM - The "Why" Thread
```
Why I built BrandOS:

🧵
```

```
I was using AI to write content.

And everything sounded... generic.

Same hooks. Same structure. Same voice as everyone else.

AI doesn't know MY brand. It just knows "content."
```

```
So I built something different.

An AI that analyzes YOUR brand first.

→ 6 months of your tweets
→ Your engagement patterns
→ Your positioning signals
→ Your unique voice

Before it creates anything.
```

```
The result: 5 AI agents that actually sound like you.

Campaign Agent — plans your launches
Content Agent — writes in your voice
Analytics Agent — finds what's working
Research Agent — spots trends early
Authority Agent — builds your positioning

All trained on YOUR Brand DNA.
```

```
Today, the first step is live:

Discover your Brand DNA Score.

What archetype are you?
How consistent is your voice?
Where are you in your brand evolution?

60 seconds. Free.
