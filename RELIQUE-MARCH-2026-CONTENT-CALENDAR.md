## Week 1: SECURITY (Mar 2-6)

*"Your cards are safer here"* — Drive trust for new depositors

---

### #1 — Monday Mar 2 | Provocative Hook | Draft 8220297

> your charizard is worth $50k. you keep it in a plastic sleeve next to your old pokemon cards.
>
> heat damages. humidity warps. theft happens.
>
> our vault is climate-controlled, insured, monitored 24/7.
>
> vault your cards on relique.

**Alt A:** that $25k jordan rookie is sitting in your closet right now. room temperature swings. zero insurance. no monitoring. vault storage exists for a reason. vault your cards on relique.

**Alt B:** collectors showing off their storage setups. cute binders. nice shelves. still not climate-controlled. still not insured. still not monitored. vault your cards on relique.

> **1/** your $10k card sitting in a closet is worth $0 if your house floods. here's how relique's vault actually works:
>
> **2/** step 1: your card arrives at our vault facility. every package tracked, insured, signed for. no exceptions.
>
> **3/** step 2: authentication by PSA/BGS/CGC experts. if it's not already graded, we grade it. if it's graded, we verify the grade is real. fake slabs get rejected.
>
> **4/** step 3: climate control kicks in. 55 degrees F constant temperature. 45% humidity. UV-filtered lighting. your card enters suspended animation.
>
> **5/** step 4: high-res digital scan. front, back, edges. uploaded to blockchain. now your card exists in two places: the vault and on-chain.
>
> **6/** step 5: you own it. trade 24/7. no shipping. no handling. no risk. instant settlement when you sell.
>
> **7/** step 6: want it back? request redemption. we ship it to you. insured. tracked. usually takes 2-3 business days.
>
> **8/** that's it. no complicated tech. no wallet drama. just professional storage for cards that deserve it. learn more at relique.io

> zero security incidents. ever.
>
> the numbers don't lie.
>

### #4 — Thursday Mar 5 | Competitive Comparison | Draft 8220300

> your $10k charizard burns in a house fire. home insurance says "collectibles aren't covered." you're out $10k.
>
> relique vault: climate-controlled, fully insured, professionally handled. ebay charges 13% and you still store at home.
>
> stop gambling with your collection.

**Alt A:** basement floods. your cards are destroyed. insurance company: "sorry, collectibles excluded." relique vault is climate-controlled and fully insured. ebay charges 13% and leaves you exposed. protect your cards on relique.

**Alt B:** theft, fire, flood. pick your disaster. home insurance rarely covers collectibles. relique includes vault storage with every trade. climate-controlled, insured, monitored 24/7. stop risking your collection at home.

---

### #5 — Friday Mar 6 | Community Poll | Draft 8220301

> where do you keep your most valuable card right now?
>
> shoebox/closet
> binder/display case
> safe/fireproof box
> professional vault
>
> we're curious -- no judgment here.
>
> tell us below

**Alt A:** that $10k card in your collection -- where's it sitting right now? shoebox in the closet / binder on the shelf / home safe / professional vault. just curious. no judgment.

**Alt B:** quick poll: your most expensive card lives where? shoebox/drawer / binder/toploader / fireproof safe / professional storage. be honest -- we won't judge. tell us below

---

### #6 — Monday Mar 9 | Provocative Hook | Draft 8220302

### #7 — Tuesday Mar 10 | Educational Thread (6 tweets) | Draft 8220303

> **1/** your pokemon card trades happen in private DMs. ours happen on a permanent ledger that everyone can verify. here's how blockchain verification works on relique (no jargon, promise):
>
> **2/** think of it like a receipt book that can't be forged. every time a card is traded, a new receipt is added. permanently. no one can erase it, change it, or fake it.
>
> **3/** when you buy a card on relique, you can see: who owned it before you, when they bought it, what they paid, that it's PSA/BGS/CGC authenticated. full history. zero guesswork.
>
> **4/** you never touch crypto. you never need a wallet. you never deal with gas fees. we handle the blockchain part. you just see a clean, verified ownership record.
>
> **5/** why does this matter? because on eBay, you trust a seller's word. on relique, you trust math. every card. every trade. every grade. permanently recorded.
>
> **6/** relique: don't trust. verify. every card, every trade, every grade lives on an immutable ledger. see it in action at relique.io

### #12 — Tuesday Mar 17 | Educational Thread (6 tweets) | Draft 8220310

> **1/** traditional card trading: list card. wait for buyer. ship card. pray it arrives. wait for payment. deal with disputes. that's 7-14 days minimum. here's what instant settlement actually looks like:
>
> **2/** on relique, your card never moves. it stays in the vault. when you sell, blockchain transfers ownership instantly. buyer owns it. you get paid. done.
>
> **3/** no packaging. no shipping labels. no trips to the post office. no tracking anxiety. no "where's my card" messages.
>
> **4/** no chargebacks either. blockchain settlement is final. no buyer claiming they "never received it." no PayPal disputes 3 months later.
>
> **5/** and it works 24/7. someone in tokyo wants your card at 3am? sold. someone in london sees a deal at 6am? settled. no business hours. no waiting.
>
> **6/** the card never leaves the vault. it's still climate-controlled, insured, monitored. ownership just changes hands digitally. experience instant settlement at relique.io

### #14 — Thursday Mar 19 | Competitive Comparison | Draft 8220312

> eBay's "13%" fee is a lie.
>

>
> relique: 8% flat. instant settlement. zero shipping risk.

## Week 4: AUTHENTICITY (Mar 23-27)

*"Real cards, real ownership"* — Convert skeptics into users

---

### #16 — Monday Mar 23 | Provocative Hook | Draft 8220315

> 1 in 4 high-value cards on secondary markets have grading concerns.
>
> altered labels. counterfeit slabs. resealed cases.

> if you can't verify it, you can't trust it.
>
> trade only verified cards on relique.

---

### #17 — Tuesday Mar 24 | Educational Thread (6 tweets) | Draft 8220316

> **1/** your buddy says his jordan rookie is "mint condition." your buddy is guessing. here's why professional grading matters and what PSA, BGS, and CGC actually do:
>
> **2/** PSA grades condition 1-10. it's the industry standard. a PSA 10 means gem mint -- perfect centering, no whitening, flawless surface. no opinion. no debate. just facts.
>
> **3/** BGS uses half-points for precision. a BGS 9.5 tells you exactly where the card falls. they also add subgrades: corners, edges, centering, surface. maximum transparency.
>
> **4/** CGC is the newest player. independent third-party verification with tamper-evident holders. growing fast because collectors want options.
>
> **5/** raw cards = someone's opinion. graded cards = professional certification. would you buy a diamond without a GIA cert? then why buy a $10k card without a grade?
>
> **6/** relique doesn't trade guesses. every card on our platform is PSA, BGS, or CGC certified. zero exceptions. zero compromises. learn more about our grading standards at relique.io

### #19 — Thursday Mar 26 | Competitive Comparison | Draft 8220318

>
> graded relique card: PSA verified, vault-stored, instant settlement, guaranteed real
>
