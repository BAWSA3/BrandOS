# Feature Validation Mapping

## Map BrandOS Features to Validated Market Needs

---

## Purpose

This document maps each BrandOS feature to market evidence that validates the need. By connecting features to case study learnings, customer signals, and competitive gaps, we demonstrate that BrandOS is building what the market demands.

---

## Validation Framework

Each feature is evaluated against four validation dimensions:

```
