# Go-to-Market Strategy

## Launch and Growth Approach

---

## GTM Philosophy

> "Find the people who feel the pain most acutely, solve their problem completely, then expand from that wedge."

BrandOS follows a **product-led growth (PLG)** strategy with targeted outbound for enterprise accounts.

---

## Market Entry Strategy

### Phase 1: Wedge Market (Months 1-6)

**Target:** Content-heavy startups (Series A-C) with small marketing teams

**Why this wedge:**
- Feel brand consistency pain acutely
- Can't afford dedicated brand managers
- Fast decision-making (no procurement)
- Active in communities we can reach
- Word-of-mouth potential

**Entry point:** Content checking (immediate value, low friction)
