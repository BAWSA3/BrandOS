### Monday: The Markup Chain Infographic

**Pillar:** Transparency

**Post:**
```
where your money actually goes when you buy a Pokemon pack

hint: it's not to the people who made it

base cost in Japan: $0.75

by the time it hits your local shop? $5-12+

that's a 500%+ markup on the same product.

here's how it breaks down:

› distributor takes 40%
› retailer takes 35%
› retail margin adds 45%
› scalpers add 200-800%

you're paying for everyone's cut except quality.

since 2020:

› prices up 140%
› 73% of new collectors priced out
› same cardboard, same ink

the hobby is being gatekept by middlemen.

this isn't about hating retailers. it's about understanding why a $0.75 product costs you $12.

knowledge is leverage.

at relique, we believe collectors deserve transparency. fair markets. real prices. no games.

follow for more breakdowns like this.

### Tuesday: The Hidden Cost of Hidden Markups (Thought Leadership)

the hidden cost of hidden markups: why TCG pricing needs transparency

when a $0.75 pack becomes $12, collectors deserve to know why.

while traditional retail chains bury their markups in complexity, the secondary market reveals true collector value through verified transactions.

here's what transparent pricing actually looks like:

› real transaction history you can verify
› professional authentication records
› global price comparison data

no hidden fees. no mystery markups.

the difference?

retail: "trust us, this is the price"
verified market: "here's exactly why this card is worth this much"

transparency beats hidden markups. every time.

collectors deserve honest pricing—not layers of middlemen taking their cut before you even open the pack.

### Wednesday: Breaking the Markup Chain (Educational)
**Type:** Long-form Post
**Pillar:** Liquidity | **Audience:** Trader

**Post:**
```
that 500%+ markup? it exists because you're trapped in regional markets.

here's how global trading changes everything.

when Japanese collectors can trade directly with US collectors on a verified platform, those artificial price gaps disappear.

geography shouldn't determine your collecting budget.

the math is simple:

› local market = limited buyers = inflated prices
› global market = worldwide demand = fair value

direct trading bypasses the middlemen entirely.

but global trading only works with trust. that's why professional authentication matters.

verified cards. verified sellers. verified transactions. international trust, built-in.

the markup chain exists because of:

› regional market traps
› limited buyer pools
› zero transparency

break one link, and the whole chain weakens.

### Thursday: Scalper Premium vs. Authenticity (Trust-Building)
**Type:** Long-form Post
**Pillar:** Authenticity | **Audience:** Collector
**Source:** Authority Agent

**Post:**
```
paying 500% markup is painful.

paying it for a fake card is devastating.

here's what you're actually paying for.

scalpers exploit FOMO with zero guarantees:

› no verification
› no authentication
› no protection

just "trust me bro" at 3x market price.

professional authentication changes the equation:

› counterfeit detection
› condition verification
› provenance tracking

every premium dollar goes toward genuine value.

the real question isn't "is this card worth $X?"

it's "is this card even real?"

authentication answers that question before you pay.

your collection deserves better than hope.

› authentic cards hold genuine value
› verified provenance protects investments
› professional grading = peace of mind
