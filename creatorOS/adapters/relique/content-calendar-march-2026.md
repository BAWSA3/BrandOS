# WEEK 1: "The Trust Problem" (March 2-8)

## Campaign: Scams, Fakes & Why Authentication Matters

### Monday, March 2 — The Singapore Scam Breakdown
**Type:** Long-form thread | **Pillar:** Authenticity | **Audience:** Collector
**Schedule:** 10:00 AM EST

**Post:**
```
$700,000 in Pokemon card scams.

477+ victims. most of them students.

this just happened in Singapore and the collecting world needs to pay attention.

here's what went down:

a seller built trust with small transactions. real cards. good prices. fast shipping.

then they scaled.

higher-value cards. bigger orders. more buyers.

except the cards stopped being real.

by the time victims caught on, the money was gone.

this is the oldest trick in collecting:

› build trust with small deals
› escalate to big-ticket items
› disappear before anyone verifies

the lesson isn't "be more careful."

the lesson is that trust alone is not authentication.

your eyes can't catch a perfect fake. your gut can't verify a PSA slab.

only professional verification can.

every card you buy should come with proof — not promises.

at relique, every card is verified before it's ever listed. not after you've already paid.

protect yourself. verify everything.
```

**Post:**

your card is only worth what it's authenticated to be.

everything else is a promise.

### Wednesday, March 4 — The PSA Fraud Story
**Type:** Long-form thread | **Pillar:** Security | **Audience:** Collector, Trader
**Schedule:** 9:00 AM EST

**Post:**
```
a man sold $2M in fake PSA-graded cards.

he just got convicted.

here's how the fakes fooled everyone — and how to make sure you never get caught.

anthony curcio ran a simple operation:

› buy cheap raw cards
› create fake PSA slabs and labels
› list them as graded 9s and 10s
› sell on eBay and Facebook groups

the labels looked real. the slabs felt real. buyers had no reason to doubt.

until PSA's own database didn't match.

here's the scary part:

most buyers never checked. they trusted the slab.

the slab is not the authentication. the verification behind it is.

how to protect yourself in 2026:

1. always cross-reference the cert number on the grading company's website
2. check that the card description matches what's in the slab
3. compare the label font, spacing, and holographic features to known authentic examples
4. if the price seems too good — it probably is
5. buy from platforms that verify before listing, not after

the conviction is good news. but for every curcio caught, there are more out there.

verification isn't optional anymore. it's survival.

at relique, every card is cross-referenced against the grading company's own database before it's ever listed. because a slab should mean something.

### Friday, March 6 — Spotting Fakes Guide
**Type:** Long-form thread | **Pillar:** Authenticity + Security | **Audience:** Collector
**Schedule:** 10:00 AM EST

**Post:**
```
5 ways to spot a fake graded card before you buy.

(2026 edition — the fakes are getting better, so should you)

1. CHECK THE CERT NUMBER

every PSA, BGS, and CGC card has a unique cert number.

go to the grading company's website. type it in. if the card doesn't match what's in front of you — walk away.

takes 30 seconds. could save you thousands.

2. EXAMINE THE LABEL

fake labels have tells:

› font spacing is slightly off
› holographic elements don't shift correctly under light
› print quality is lower than genuine labels
› barcode doesn't scan or scans to wrong data

3. FEEL THE SLAB

real slabs have a specific weight and texture. if you've held enough genuine ones, fakes feel wrong.

› sonic-welded seams should be clean
› no bubbles or gaps in the case
› consistent thickness throughout

4. COMPARE TO KNOWN AUTHENTIC

pull up verified images of the same card and grade. compare everything:

› centering matches the grade given
› surface quality matches the grade
› label information is complete and accurate

5. BUY FROM VERIFIED SOURCES

the easiest way to avoid fakes? buy from platforms that verify before you see the listing.

not after. not "buyer beware." before.

this is what relique does. every card authenticated and verified before it ever hits the marketplace.

CGC just recalled 1,500+ cards over counterfeit concerns. the grading companies themselves are catching problems.

your defense? verify everything. trust nothing at face value.

save this thread. share it with a collector who needs it.

### Sunday, March 8 — The CGC Recall Deep Dive
**Type:** Long-form thread | **Pillar:** Security | **Audience:** Collector, Trader
**Schedule:** 7:00 PM EST

**Post:**
```
CGC just recalled 1,500+ cards.

counterfeit prototypes made it through their system and into the market.

here's what happened and what it means for grading trust.

the short version:

cards submitted as "prototype" Pokemon cards were graded and encapsulated by CGC.

problem: many of them weren't real prototypes. they were manufactured fakes designed to exploit the prototype premium.

CGC caught it. they issued a recall. but some of those cards already traded hands.

what this tells us:

1. even grading companies can be fooled
2. prototype and error cards are prime targets for fakes
3. a slab alone does not guarantee authenticity

this isn't an attack on CGC. they did the right thing by issuing the recall.

but it proves something we've been saying:

one layer of verification is not enough.

at relique, cards go through multi-point authentication before they're ever listed.

› grading company verification
› independent cross-reference
› provenance documentation
› visual inspection by certified experts

the goal isn't to replace grading companies. it's to add layers so collectors are protected even when systems fail.

your collection deserves more than one line of defense.

### Monday, March 9 — The Grading Company Breakdown
**Type:** Long-form thread | **Pillar:** Transparency | **Audience:** Collector, Trader
**Schedule:** 10:00 AM EST

**Post:**
```
PSA vs BGS vs CGC — the honest breakdown for 2026.

which grading company should you trust with your cards?

(no sponsorship. no bias. just data and experience.)

PSA

› the industry standard. highest resale premiums.
› turnaround times have improved since the 2021 backlog
› most recognized globally — if you're selling, PSA commands the best prices
› label is clean and simple
› weakness: cert verification is basic. the curcio fraud proved labels can be faked.

BGS

› the "collector's grade." subgrades tell the full story.
› a BGS 10 Black Label is the holy grail of grading
› best for high-end collectors who want detailed condition data
› weakness: lower liquidity than PSA. harder to sell quickly.

CGC

› the newcomer gaining ground fast.
› competitive pricing and faster turnaround
› subgrades available like BGS
› weakness: the recent 1,500+ card recall raised questions about QC
› still building long-term trust

which should you use?

› selling soon? PSA (highest resale premium)
› long-term collecting? BGS (most detail)
› budget-conscious? CGC (competitive pricing)

the real answer: the best grading company is the one whose verification you can independently confirm.

that's why relique cross-references every card against the grading company's own database. trust, verified.

hot take:

an ungraded card is an unauthenticated card.

### Thursday, March 12 — Prismatic Evolutions Price Guide
**Type:** Long-form thread | **Pillar:** Transparency | **Audience:** Collector, Trader
**Schedule:** 2:00 PM EST

**Post:**
```
the Prismatic Evolutions price guide — march 2026 edition.

what's still climbing. what's cooling. and what to watch.

the set dropped hot. reprints happened. here's where things stand.

STILL CLIMBING:

› Umbreon ex SIR — hovering around $1,000. supply is tightening as reprints slow down.
› Sylveon ex SIR — steady demand. the art is carrying this one.
› Eevee illustration rare — the sleeper of the set. collectors are catching on.

COOLING OFF:

› most regular ex cards — initial hype is fading to fair market value.
› common eeveelution holos — supply finally catching up with demand.
› sealed product premiums — retail restocks are leveling prices.

WATCH LIST:

› Umbreon ex SIR graded PSA 10 — if reprints truly stop, this could push past $1,200.
› Jolteon ex SIR — undervalued compared to siblings. could be the set's sleeper.
› sealed booster boxes — if this was the last reprint wave, sealed will climb.

the big picture:

Prismatic Evolutions is transitioning from hype to established value. the cards that hold are the ones with genuine collector demand — not FOMO.

know what you're buying. know what it's worth. know what's real.

that's transparency. that's how we build a market that works for collectors.

relique tracks verified pricing data so you can make decisions based on facts, not hype.

### Sunday, March 15 — Pokemon 30th Anniversary
**Type:** Long-form thread | **Pillar:** All | **Audience:** Collector
**Schedule:** 7:00 PM EST

**Post:**
```
Pokemon is 30 years old.

from a Game Boy game to a $100B+ franchise. and the TCG? it's become one of the most collected things on earth.

here's how the card market has evolved — and where it's going next.

THE EARLY YEARS (1996-2010)

› cards were for playing, not investing
› Base Set Charizard was the holy grail but you could find one for $50
› the market was local — card shops and schoolyard trades
› no grading culture. no authentication. just vibes.

THE AWAKENING (2011-2019)

› YouTube unboxings created a new kind of collector
› vintage cards started climbing in price
› PSA submissions exploded
› the first whispers of "cards as investments"

THE BOOM (2020-2022)

› Logan Paul. COVID. stimulus checks.
› Base Set Charizard hit $400K+
› grading companies were backlogged for months
› everyone became a card investor overnight
› fakes flooded the market at scale

THE CORRECTION (2023-2025)

› prices normalized. tourists left.
› real collectors stayed and built
› grading trust became a real conversation
› authentication went from nice-to-have to essential

WHERE WE'RE GOING (2026+)

› tokenized cards hitting $124.5M in volume
› professional vaulting replacing shoebox storage
› instant global trading replacing eBay auctions
› authentication as the baseline, not the exception

the hobby has survived 30 years because collectors care deeply about these cards.

the next 30 years will be defined by how well we protect them.

here's to the collectors who've been here since the beginning — and the ones just getting started.

# WEEK 3: "The Market Shift" (March 16-22)

## Campaign: RWA, Tokenization & The Future of Collecting

| Pillar Focus | Liquidity + Transparency |
| Content Mix | 3 long-form threads, 4 short-form tweets |
| Goal | Introduce collectors to tokenized trading and position Relique as the bridge |

### Monday, March 16 — Tokenized Cards Explainer
**Type:** Long-form thread | **Pillar:** Liquidity | **Audience:** Collector, Trader
**Schedule:** 10:00 AM EST

**Post:**
```
tokenized Pokemon cards just hit $124.5M in trading volume.

that's a 5.5x increase from last year.

here's what that actually means for collectors — in plain english.

"tokenization" sounds complicated. it's not.

here's the simple version:

1. a real, graded card goes into a professional vault
2. a digital token is created that proves you own that card
3. you can trade that token instantly to anyone in the world
4. the buyer can redeem the token for the physical card anytime

that's it. no crypto jargon. no complicated wallets.

just a better way to trade cards.

why does this matter?

OLD WAY:
› list card on eBay
› wait for auction to end
› ship the card (risk of damage)
› wait for delivery
› hope the buyer doesn't file a false claim
› wait for payment to clear
› total time: 7-14 days

TOKENIZED WAY:
› list the card
› buyer purchases instantly
› ownership transfers in seconds
› card stays safe in the vault
› total time: minutes

$124.5M in volume means collectors are voting with their wallets.

they want faster, safer, more transparent trading.

this isn't replacing physical cards. your collection is still real. your cards are still yours.

it's just removing every unnecessary step between you and a fair trade.

relique is building exactly this. real cards. real ownership. real liquidity.

the future of collecting isn't coming. it's already here.

you shouldn't have to ship a card to sell it.

that's not a hot take, that's just common sense.

shipping = risk. delays. cost. damage.

relique keeps your card in the vault. ownership moves instantly. the card stays safe.

there's a better way. and collectors are figuring it out.

### Thursday, March 19 — Premium Collections Guide
**Type:** Long-form thread | **Pillar:** Authenticity | **Audience:** Collector
**Schedule:** 2:00 PM EST

**Post:**
```
Mega Lucario & Mega Gardevoir Premium Collections drop tomorrow.

here's what you need to know before you buy — and what's actually chase-worthy.

WHAT'S IN THE BOX:

each Premium Collection includes:
› 1 etched promo card (Mega Lucario or Mega Gardevoir)
› 7 booster packs
› 1 full-art promo
› collector's pin
› online code cards

WHAT'S CHASE-WORTHY:

› the etched promo cards are exclusive to these collections. if mega evolutions hold value (and with Perfect Order dropping next week, they will), these promos become the early plays.

› 7 packs is a solid pull opportunity. current sets include Prismatic Evolutions packs in some regions — confirm before buying.

WHAT TO WATCH:

› MSRP is ~$40-50. anything over $60 is scalper premium.
› first-wave allocation is always limited. if you want one at retail, don't wait.
› the Mega Gardevoir promo has historically stronger collector demand.

GRADING POTENTIAL:

› etched promos can grade well if you open carefully
› centering on premium collection promos has been inconsistent — check before submitting
› a PSA 10 of an exclusive promo can be 5-10x the raw price within a year

if you're picking these up tomorrow, inspect before you buy. check for box damage. check the seal.

and if you pull something special — get it authenticated before you list it.

that's how you protect the value of what you just opened.

### Saturday, March 21 — eBay Comparison
**Type:** Long-form thread | **Pillar:** Liquidity + Transparency | **Audience:** Trader, Seller
**Schedule:** 11:00 AM EST

**Post:**
```
let's do the math on selling a $500 card.

SELLING ON EBAY:

› eBay fee (13.25%): -$66.25
› PayPal/payment processing: -$15.00
› shipping + insurance: -$15.00
› packaging materials: -$5.00
› your time (photos, listing, shipping): ~45 min
› risk of buyer scam/return: real
› time to get paid: 3-5 days

you keep: ~$398.75
you lose: $101.25 + your afternoon

SELLING ON A VERIFIED PLATFORM:

› lower platform fee: -$40.00
› no shipping cost (card stays in vault): $0
› no packaging: $0
› listing time: 2 minutes
› risk of buyer scam: eliminated (verified ownership)
› time to get paid: instant

you keep: ~$460.00
you lose: $40.00

that's $61.25 more in your pocket. no shipping anxiety. no wasted afternoon.

multiply that across 10 cards. 50 cards. 100 cards.

the old way costs you thousands in fees, hours in labor, and constant shipping risk.

relique is building the platform collectors actually deserve.

lower fees. instant settlement. cards stay safe. always verified.

the math doesn't lie.

**Post:**
```
Standard Format Rotation hits March 26.

if you play competitively, everything changes in 2 days.

here's what's leaving, what stays, and how the meta shifts.

WHAT'S ROTATING OUT:

all cards with the "G" regulation mark are leaving Standard.

this includes sets from:
› Scarlet & Violet base
› Paldea Evolved
› Obsidian Flames
› 151

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR DECKS:

if your deck relies heavily on G-mark cards, it's time to rebuild.

key losses:
› several meta-defining trainer cards
› popular draw engines
› format staple Pokemon

WHAT STAYS:

everything with "H" regulation mark and newer. this includes:
› Stellar Crown
› Surging Sparks
› Prismatic Evolutions
› and Perfect Order (dropping March 27)

HOW THE META SHIFTS:

› slower format expected. less draw power in the card pool.
› mega evolutions from Perfect Order could define new archetypes
› expect a "brewer's paradise" for the first few weeks as the meta is wide open

MARKET IMPACT:

› rotating cards typically drop 20-40% in value
› some will hold as collector pieces regardless of playability
› new format staples from Perfect Order will spike hard

for competitive players: this is where deck-building skill matters most. the netdeckers don't have lists yet.

for collectors: rotation cards at their floor can be long-term value plays.

know the format. know the value. make informed decisions.

CHASE CARDS TO WATCH:

› Mega Charizard ex SAR — the crown jewel. expect this to be the most expensive card in the set by a wide margin.
› Mega Rayquaza ex SAR — nostalgia + power = demand.
› Mega Gardevoir ex SIR — art quality will drive collector demand.
› Mega Lucario ex SIR — competitive viability adds value.
› any new Eevee-related cards — the eeveelution tax is real.

EXPECTED PULL RATES:

based on recent sets:
› illustration rare: ~1 per 10-15 packs
› SAR (special art rare): ~1 per 30-40 packs
› SIR (special illustration rare): ~1 per 60-80 packs
› hyper rare/gold: ~1 per 40-50 packs

(these are estimates. actual rates may vary.)

WHICH CARDS TO GET GRADED:

› any SAR or SIR you pull — these hold the most long-term value when graded
› check centering IMMEDIATELY after pulling. off-center = PSA 8 max.
› mega evolution promos from Premium Collections
› hold grading submissions 2-3 weeks. prices stabilize and you can make a smarter decision.

THE RELIQUE TAKE:

we'll be tracking Perfect Order prices and authentication trends from day one.

if you pull something special tomorrow — congratulations. now protect it.

get it sleeved immediately. check the centering. and when you're ready to authenticate, make sure it's done right.

this is going to be a huge set. have fun with it.

**Schedule:** 11:00 AM EST

**Post:**
```
march 2026 recap.

this month was wild for collectors. let's break it down.

THE SCAM PROBLEM:
› $700K Singapore Pokemon scam exposed — 477+ victims
› PSA fraud conviction — $2M in fake graded cards
› CGC recalled 1,500+ cards over counterfeit prototypes

the message is clear: authentication isn't optional anymore.

THE MARKET:
› Prismatic Evolutions stabilizing — Umbreon ex SIR holding ~$1K
› tokenized Pokemon cards hit $124.5M in trading volume
› sealed product premiums normalizing as reprints hit shelves

the market is maturing. hype is giving way to fundamentals.

THE CULTURE:
› Pokemon turned 30 — nostalgia wave bringing new collectors
› Costco fights went viral — the supply problem is real
› Perfect Order dropped — mega evolutions are back and the hype is justified

THE FUTURE:
› Standard rotation reshuffled the competitive meta
› tokenized trading volume up 5.5x year over year
› collector demand for authentication at an all-time high

what we learned this month:

1. trust but verify. always.
2. the market rewards patience and knowledge
3. new technology is making collecting safer, faster, and fairer
4. the hobby is growing — and growing up

relique is here for the collectors who want transparency, authentication, and a market that works for them.

see you in april. it's going to be even bigger.
