## Cross-Audience Content

Some content resonates across all three personas:

**Universal Hooks:**
- Authenticity and realness
- Behind-the-scenes of building anything
- Lessons learned from failure
- "I did X, here's what happened"
- Contrarian but thoughtful takes

**Example:**
```
"shipped my first product

day 1 revenue: $0
downloads: 12

but I learned more in that week than 6 months of tutorials

the lesson? shipping is the best teacher

doesn't matter if it's code, content, or crypto

just ship"
```
This post works for all three because it touches on building, creating, and the universal lesson of shipping.
