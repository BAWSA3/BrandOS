the best thing about CT?

you can be anonymous and still build a reputation

no credentials. no connections. no gatekeeping.

just you, your ideas, and your execution

been here 3 years now

the frens i've made are worth more than any bags

this space is different. cherish it.
```

**Thread Hook:**
```
hard truth CT doesn't want to hear:

your "brand" isn't a laser-eyed pfp and a bio full of projects

it's not "GM" spams or alpha calls

it's not even your takes

it's why anyone should give a f*ck about YOUR version of those things

vibe coding is not a meme

it's a paradigm shift

the barrier to building just collapsed

if you're not learning these tools rn you're going to wake up left behind

I shipped a full app in 48 hours using only AI tools

no previous experience with the stack

here's exactly how I did it

## Cross-Pillar Content

Some content naturally spans multiple pillars. This is encouraged for variety.

### Crypto + Tech
```
Topic: "Building a Web3 tool using AI"
Example: "just shipped a wallet tracker using cursor

no solidity experience needed

vibe coded the whole thing

here's how web3 + AI tools = superpowers"
```

### Tech + Personal
```
Topic: "What shipping this project taught me"
Example: "launched my first product last week

revenue day 1: $0
downloads: 12

but I learned more in that week than 6 months of tutorials

the lesson? shipping is the best teacher"
```

### Personal + Crypto
```
Topic: "My journey into CT"
Example: "2 years ago I had 200 followers and zero clue

today I've built products, made frens for life, and found my thing

CT changed my trajectory

here's what the first year taught me"
```

## Pillar Detection Rules

When classifying an idea, check for:

1. **Primary keywords** from each pillar's keyword list
2. **Topic alignment** with the categories listed
3. **Audience fit** - who would care most about this?

**If unclear**, default to asking:
> "This could be a [Pillar A] post or a [Pillar B] post. Which angle do you want to take?"

**Cross-pillar signals:**
- Contains keywords from 2+ pillars
- Could appeal to multiple audiences
- Natural bridge between topics
