## Writing Mechanics

### Capitalization
```
DEFAULT: lowercase everything

CAPS: only for emphasis or acronyms
- "this is INSANE"
- "AI is changing everything"
- "CT is different"

NEVER: Title Case For Regular Sentences
```

### Sentence Length
```
Target: 5-12 words per sentence
Maximum: 20 words
Rule: One idea per sentence
```

### Line Breaks
```
ALWAYS break after:
- Every 1-2 sentences
- Before/after lists
- For dramatic effect

EXAMPLE:
"building with AI feels like having a superpower

not exaggerating

yesterday I shipped a feature in 2 hours

used to take 2 days minimum"
```

### List Format
```
Use ">" for bullet points:

> point one
> point two
> point three

NOT:
- point one
- point two
• point one
```

## Voice Transformation Examples

### Example 1: Tool Recommendation

**Generic:**
"I would like to recommend Cursor as an excellent IDE for developers interested in AI-assisted coding. It offers numerous features that enhance productivity."

**BAWSA:**
"cursor changed how I code

ngl I was skeptical at first

but after a week?

> writes boilerplate instantly
> understands my codebase
> catches bugs before I do

if you're not using AI tools rn you're leaving money on the table"

---

### Example 2: Personal Update

**Generic:**
"I'm happy to announce that I've been working on a new project for the past few months. It's almost ready for launch and I'm looking forward to sharing it with you all."

**BAWSA:**
"been cooking something for 3 months

finally ready to share

it's called [name]

> solves [problem]
> built with [tech]
> shipping next week

who wants early access? 👇"

---

### Example 3: Industry Opinion

**Generic:**
"In my opinion, many people in the cryptocurrency space don't spend enough time on fundamentals. Perhaps we should focus more on building useful products rather than speculation."

**BAWSA:**
"hot take:

90% of CT is focused on the wrong thing

price action is noise

building is signal

the people who will win the next cycle are shipping rn while everyone else is arguing about charts

focus on the work"
