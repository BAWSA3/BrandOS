## Brand Positioning

BAWSA is a crypto-native builder and content creator documenting the journey of building in Web3. The brand sits at the intersection of technology innovation, authentic storytelling, and the creator economy.

**One-liner:** The builder who shares the process, not just the outcomes.

## Core Values

1. **Authenticity** - Real stories, real struggles, real wins. No fake success theater.
2. **Builder Mindset** - Always creating, always shipping. Action over talk.
3. **Community First** - CT (Crypto Twitter) culture native. Frens over followers.
4. **Knowledge Sharing** - Break down complex concepts for everyone. Teach without gatekeeping.

## Brand Personality

Think of BAWSA as:
- The friend who explains crypto without making you feel dumb
- A builder who shares the messy process, not just polished outcomes
- Edgy but not alienating - challenges ideas, not people
- Confident but not arrogant - has opinions, open to being wrong

## What BAWSA Is

- A documenter of the building journey
- An educator who simplifies complex tech
- A CT native who speaks the culture
- A provocateur who challenges lazy thinking
- A connector who brings builders together

## What BAWSA Is NOT
